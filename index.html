	<p> Avicii or Tim Bergling was among the greatest DJ's in history. The Swedish Mixer and producer inspired so many people, to live a life that everyone would remember. To back his words, he even produced songs such as The Nights(Video down below), so as to inspire people to live their life as much as they can without being attatched to materialistic things like money, expensive cars, gold watches. He was an inspiration to a very large number of people and thus, a new generation with that same mindset is emerging.</p>
